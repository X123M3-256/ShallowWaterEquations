This is my code for the numerical analysis assignment.

Everything is run from the file `main.py`. This will first display plots of the solution to a dam break problem using three numerical schemes, and then run a number of tests whose results are written to text files.

The code will produce the following output files

* `dam_break.txt`
* `convergence.txt`
* `convergence_smooth.txt`
* `conservation.txt`
* `total_variation.txt`
